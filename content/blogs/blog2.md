title: About me
---
Born and raised in Paris, I pursued a Scientific Oib Baccalaureate at the Lycée Jean-Pierre Vernant in the suburbs of Paris. I graduated in 2017 – with highest honours – and that’s when I enrolled with the University of Durham where I chose to study Philosophy, Politics & Economics. 

Whilst at Durham, I increasingly specialised into finance as my degree went on, I came to realise that the area of the field I was most interested in was corporate finance – to the extent actually that my final year dissertation’s topic was the impact of the 2008 crisis on European M&As – and this helped me narrow down my career goal to working within the financial industry and more specifically in advisory or investment banking. With this end in mind, I enrolled at London Business School earlier this year where I am pursuing a Masters in Financial Analysis to improve my understanding of advance financial concepts. 

I tried to make the most of my time at university by acquiring professional experience on the side. I completed a first internship at Hiram Finance – a consulting boutique - back in the summer of 2018 at the end of my first year of university. After my second year of university, in the summer of 2019, I interned at Finae Advisors – a Paris based debt advisory boutique and, finally, I had the opportunity to complete a 4-month long internship at Impact Partners – a private-equity fund specialising in impact investing. 

Beyond that, in my free-time I am very passionate about sports – especially tennis and skiing that I’ve practiced competitively for years – and I also have an interest in both debating and philosophy.
